# Usage

python acm2wp [input.html] [output.html] [replacements.txt]

# Visual Studio Code Example Workflow

Install Visual Studio Code [![VSCode Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/-VSCode%20Download-007acc?logo=Visual+Studio+Code&logoColor=FFFFFF)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Within VSCode install the python extension [![Python extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python%20Extension-007acc?logo=Python+Extension&logoColor=FFFFFF)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

Open the local folder where you have cloned or downloaded this github project from within VSCode

Open this project's acm2wp.py file in VSCode

The steps for getting the right format of markup is a follows,
* Select and copy only the article's text with references of any open article from the digital library.
* Paste into the ACM Games wordpress editor window with visual mode selected.
* Select text mode, copy that text with the refined html markup.
* Then place into an [input.html] file in the project folder.

Click Run+Debug in VSCode (SHIFT+CMD+D on Mac)

Add command-line arguments for the files, "-Iinput.html -Ooutput.html -Rreplacements.txt" and return will run the script

You may also install the HTML Preview extension to preview intput and output html files as they would in a browser, and check for conversions of reference links and headings, any corrections of digital library formatting, etc.

The resulting output.html file's contents will have the format suitable for pasting into the text field of a wordpress post.
That is, in wordpress editor's post content field, select 'text' as opposed to 'visual' and paste in the output.html file's content.

Save draft and preview. The result should be similar to that seen in VSCode html preview window.


# Notes

Different articles have different headings and issues, so replacements.txt might sensibly update according to these as encountered.
